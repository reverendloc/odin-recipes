      <h2 class="heading">Description</h2>
      <p>
        These are the best biscuits Morgan has ever tried. Better than his
        mom's. Flaky, substantial, and buttery delicious.
      </p>

      <h2 class="heading">Ingredients</h2>

      <ul class="ingredients_list">
        <li>195g sourdough starter discard</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>170g All Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp fine sea salt</li>
        <li>115g (8tbsp) unsalted, frozen butter</li>
        <li>2 ounces shredded cheese (optional)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="heading">Steps</h2>

      <ol class="recipe_steps">
        <li>Whisk together starter and egg.</li>
        <li>Stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.</li>
        <li>
          Use the large hole side of a grater to grate the butter. Make sure to
          scrape and use all the butter from the inside of the grater when you
          are done. Toss the butter into the flour, and rub gently to get the
          flour to stick to some of the butter. Toss in cheese if using.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make a well in the middle of the flour mixture and pour in starter
          mixture. Stir with a spatula to combine, until only a few dry spots
          remain. The dough will be very shaggy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place dough on a counter and knead for 10 seconds to bring it
          together. You do not want to overwork the dough, but it should roughly
          stick together. Using rolling pin to roll dough into a 1/2 inch
          thickness. Fold 1/3 of the dough up and over to the middle of the
          dough (using bench scraper if needed), then do fold the other 1/3
          dough up and over, to create what is like an envelope fold. Fold up
          the short edges to make a square. (This folding is too make all the
          layers! It doesnâ€™t have to be perfect.) Then roll square out to 3/4
          inch of thick. It is better for them thicker than too thin.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dip biscuit cutter in flour and push straight down and pull straight
          back out. Do not twist, or you will seal the edges and not have flaky
          layers.
        </li>
        <li>
          With the remaining dough scraps push and gently knead back together
          and cut one or two more biscuits. Place on a parchment lined baking
          sheet. Place biscuits in freezer while oven preheats to 450 degrees F.
        </li>
        <li>
          When oven is ready, sprinkle a little cheese on top of biscuits if you
          are using. Bake on the middle rack for 18 to 22 minutes, or until
          golden brown. Remove from oven and let cool on wire rack. Enjoy the
          day you bake them.
